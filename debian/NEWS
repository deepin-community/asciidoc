asciidoc (8.6.10+git20190307.51d7c14-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  This new version of asciidoc is using the unreleased python3 implementation
  as python2 is deprecated. This implementation has a very low maturity to it
  and has not seen an upstream release yet. As the maintenance of this upstream
  is very low and they advise to use asciidoctor in the past, we advise you to
  use asciidoctor instead as it is now the official reference for the AsciiDoc
  language and is way ahead of this Python implementation both in terms of
  maintenance and support of language features.

asciidoc (8.6.9-4) unstable; urgency=low

  The asciidoc package has been split into several other packages to
  bring more flexibility and to lower the dependencies for people using only
  man pages and html files generation. (Closes: #692274, #637006)
  The asciidoc binary package is now a meta package that brings
  asciidoc-dblatex and others packages to keep the current behavior.
